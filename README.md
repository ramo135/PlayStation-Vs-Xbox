# PlayStation-Vs-Xbox

- The reason for this project was to find out the difference in popularity between PlayStation and Xbox, and how that popularity has changed throughout the generations of new consoles. The first task was to find a file in Kaggle that had overall console sales. As you can see in my SQL file, I had to seperate all PlayStation and Xbox products to showcase just the two brands. I then created indivudual charts in Tableau to create a visualization between each console and how many were sold globaly. I took it a step further and created a stacked bar chart would show the console sales within each region(North America, Europe, Japan, Rest of World). Overall, it is clear that PlayStation is the winner, and has gained the popularity through the geneerations, and may continue to overpower Xbox in the years to come.
